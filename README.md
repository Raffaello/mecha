## Mecha

SBT plugin that automates super-repository management.

A super-repository is a repository in which there are multiple source controlled
repositories for different projects.
Mecha is an ideal solution when you want to compile your projects against the
latest version of fast moving dependencies, as the source codes of all your projects
get pulled, compiled, committed, and pushed together.
Guaranteed to boost productivity!

- bulk pull, branch, merge, push, and mirroring for child repositories
- optional tracking for child repositories
- automatic source/library dependency configuration in child repositories
- automatic configuration file generation
